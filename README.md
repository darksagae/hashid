### Using HashID on Kali Linux

**HashID** is a tool used to identify the type of hash based on its format. It's useful for determining which hash algorithms may have been used to encode a password.

#### Installation

HashID is typically pre-installed in Kali Linux. To verify its installation, you can run:

```bash
hashid --version
```

If it's not installed, you can install it using:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install hashid
```

#### Basic Usage

The basic syntax for using HashID is:

```bash
hashid [options] <hash>
```

You can also specify a file containing hashes.

#### Examples

1. **Identifying a Single Hash**:

   To identify a single hash, you can run:

   ```bash
   hashid 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
   ```

   **Expected Output**:

   ```
   [*] Hash: 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
   [*] Type: MD5
   ```

2. **Identifying Multiple Hashes from a File**:

   If you have a file named `hashes.txt` containing multiple hashes:

   ```plaintext
   5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
   b109f3bbbc244eb82441917ed06d618b9008dd09
   ```

   You can identify them with:

   ```bash
   hashid -f hashes.txt
   ```

   **Expected Output**:

   ```
   [*] Hash: 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
   [*] Type: MD5
   [*] Hash: b109f3bbbc244eb82441917ed06d618b9008dd09
   [*] Type: SHA1
   ```

3. **Verbose Mode**:

   For more detailed information, you can use the verbose option `-v`:

   ```bash
   hashid -v 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
   ```

   **Expected Output**:

   ```
   [*] Hash: 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
   [*] Type: MD5
   [*] Description: Message-Digest Algorithm 5
   ```

### Conclusion

HashID is a straightforward tool for identifying hash types, making it essential for password recovery and security assessments. Always use it responsibly and only on hashes you have permission to analyze.

Hashid is a tool in Kali Linux used to identify the type of hash. Here's how to use it and some examples:

**Basic Usage:**

The basic syntax of Hashid is:
```
hashid [hash]
```
Replace `[hash]` with the hash you want to identify.

**Examples:**

1. Identify an MD5 hash:
```
hashid 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
```
Output:
```
Analyzing '5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99'
[+] MD5
```
2. Identify a SHA-1 hash:
```
hashid 5baa61e5b0c090b4b11e8bda1d3b3e0d
```
Output:
```
Analyzing '5baa61e5b0c090b4b11e8bda1d3b3e0d'
[+] SHA-1
```
3. Identify a password hash:
```
hashid $6$rounds=5000$ZHVtb25naW5n$3XvR7l6KQ6L9KqL9KqL9KqL9KqL9
```
Output:
```
Analyzing '$6$rounds=5000$ZHVtb25naW5n$3XvR7l6KQ6L9KqL9KqL9KqL9KqL9'
[+] SHA-512 (Unix)
```
**Output:**

The output of Hashid will indicate the type of hash, such as MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, etc. It may also provide additional information, such as the hash format (e.g., Unix, Windows) or the algorithm used (e.g., bcrypt).

**Tips:**

* Hashid can identify a wide range of hash types, including password hashes, file hashes, and cryptographic hashes.
* You can use Hashid to identify unknown hashes or to verify the type of hash used in a specific application or system.
* Hashid is a useful tool for penetration testers, security researchers, and anyone interested in cryptography and hash analysis.

Here's how to use the `hashid` tool in Kali Linux, along with examples and expected outputs:

**About `hashid`**

`hashid` is a tool in Kali Linux that helps identify the type of hash used to encrypt a password or other data. It's a useful companion to password cracking tools like `hashcat`, as knowing the hash type is essential for selecting the right cracking approach.

**Installation**

`hashid` is pre-installed in Kali Linux. You can verify its presence by running:

```
hashid --version
```

**Basic Usage**

The basic syntax for using `hashid` is:

```
hashid [options] <hash>
```

Here are some common options:

- `-m`: Displays the possible hash types.
- `-j`: Outputs the results in JSON format.
- `-h`: Shows the help menu.

**Examples**

1. **Identifying an MD5 Hash**:

```
echo "5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99" | hashid
```

Output:
```
Analyzing '5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99'
[+] MD5
[+] MD4
[+] Half MD5
```

This shows that the given hash is likely an MD5 hash.

2. **Identifying a SHA-256 Hash**:

```
echo "2c21f1cca3739d5b7c9d4cd971e6ef89e0c34e5c6add5f8d6cf2c9fabcd71e8b" | hashid
```

Output:
```
Analyzing '2c21f1cca3739d5b7c9d4cd971e6ef89e0c34e5c6add5f8d6cf2c9fabcd71e8b'
[+] SHA-256
```

This identifies the hash as a SHA-256 hash.

3. **Identifying a Salted Hash**:

```
echo "$6$rounds=656000$RANDOMSALT$hashedpassword" | hashid
```

Output:
```
Analyzing '$6$rounds=656000$RANDOMSALT$hashedpassword'
[+] SHA-512 (Unix)
[+] GRUB 2
```

This identifies the hash as a salted SHA-512 (Unix) hash.

**Expected Outputs**

The output of `hashid` will provide the possible hash types for the given input. It may list multiple hash types if the input matches the characteristics of several hash algorithms.

The output format is usually a list of hash types, prefixed with a `[+]` if the hash type is identified, or a `[-]` if it's a possible match but not definitive.

By using `hashid`, you can quickly determine the hash type, which is essential for selecting the appropriate cracking approach with tools like `hashcat`.

### Examples

1.  **Identifying a Hash Directly**:

    *   Command:

    ```bash
    hashid 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
    ```
    *   Expected Output:

    ```text

    [+] Possible Hash(es) Identified:
    [+]     MD5
    [+]     md5($pass.$salt)
    [+]     md5($salt.$pass)
    ```
    This output indicates that the provided hash is likely an MD5 hash.
2.  **Identifying Hashes from a File**:

    *   Create a file named `hashes.txt` with the following content:

    ```text
    5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
    da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709
    ```
    *   Command:

    ```bash
    hashid hashes.txt
    ```
    *   Expected Output:

    ```text
    Analyzing '5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99'
    [+] Possible Hash(es) Identified:
    [+]     MD5
